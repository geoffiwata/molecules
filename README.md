Molecule-light interaction simulations

These mathematica notebooks are all related to various calculations regarding the Barium monohydride molecule. 

APi_ZeemanHam: Zeeman hamiltonian for the APi state in BaH. Based on estimations from various molecular constants, and takes into account some mixing due to nearby electronic states. However, there is some unaccounted for mixing due to nearby vibrational levels.
